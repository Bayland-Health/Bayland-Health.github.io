## What is DMS?
DMS stands for DPL Management System which is a dashboard web application that presents real-time corporate and market data to its users built using the Streamlit library. 
DMS utilizes the existing cloud infrastructure and datasets to democratize data share and analytics for the entire company.

## Why do we need DMS?
Many of my colleagues suffered from slow and complicated reporting methods. 
A simple query about the total number of units sold yesterday will require logging into many different accounts finding the corresponding numbers and summing to get the final result, which could take anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes depending on the complexity. 
With DMS, we can present ready-to-use data from our database with caching enabled to shorten this querying process to less than a half second.
